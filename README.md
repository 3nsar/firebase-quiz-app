# firebase-quiz-app
 This quiz app allows you to advance to higher levels by answering 7 out of 10 questions correctly. The main objective is to unlock all the secret cards. For this project, I utilized React JS and Google Firebase v9. With Firebase's assistance, your progress will be saved automatically.
